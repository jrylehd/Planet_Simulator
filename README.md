# Orbit Simulator
Using the given equations, we create and earth class and moon class.
Each .py file performs its main program which lists their coordinates at a given day.
We use the Python integrated GUI, Tkinter.
In spirals.py, we visualize the code by dot tracing the coordinates on the canvas.
The visualization represents the rotation of the earth around the sun and the moon around the earth.
